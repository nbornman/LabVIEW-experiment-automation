# LabVIEW-experiment-automation
This project contains LabVIEW virtual instrument programmes (divided into three different subfolders) used to automate a number of experiments performed in my group's quantum photonics laboratory at the University of the Witwatersrand. I did not write any of the subVIs in the roto-flip mount subfolder, but wrote almost all of the other VIs (save for one or two of the smaller files).

Written by: Nicholas Bornman (with some smaller VIs written by Prof. Jonathan Leach and his colleagues at Heriot-Watt University)
